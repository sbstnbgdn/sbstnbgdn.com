        <br />
        <p>
          Recently I feel like I've entered a new stage of life. And, I started
          to think...wtf is a stage of life?! Does that lens really help me when
          I know I'm growing continuously? 🤔<br /><br />It's easy for me to
          look back on my existence and say "oh, that's when I was friends with
          X, or when I was doing Y job or when I was going through LMNOP",
          y'know what I mean?<br /><br />That emo stage...that was REAL (yep, I
          had one too 🙄) but it's also more than that. The people around me at
          that stage of life were soooo different to the people I have in my
          circle of friends now. We crossed for that moment and now we're in
          different stages. 💁‍♀️<br /><br />When depression massively took over my
          life for a year, I lost a lot. A lot of friends, a relationship, my
          sanity. It was really fucking hard. And all I wanted back then was for
          those people to stay, but that didn't happen. I was "too much" for
          them to handle. And I just had to accept it... 😔<br /><br />The idea
          of life stages made accepting losing those relationships easier. We
          were at different stages, and they went down a different path, one
          that doesn't include me. I can't beg people to stay in my life - and I
          don't need to - I just have to move onto the next stage, with more
          compatible friends.<br /><br />Still, losing people fucking sucks.
          Change is HARD! There's no particular stage we need to get to. But
          knowing and accepting our own stage can make things easier for us and
          a LOT more pleasurable. So let it happen, my love. Don't beat yourself
          up over the past, or the future. Love the stage you're at! 😘❤️

            Setting boundaries has NEVER been my strong point, in friendships,
            in relationships, with anyone tbh! 🤣 It was one of my friends who
            brought this up to me actually, and they said I was being a bit of
            “pushover”. And I couldn't disagree with them, at all, because it
            was true 😬 I'd rather let someone cross the line than make a big
            fuss about it and be 'difficult'. But sometimes, we HAVE to be
            difficult whether we like it or not. Our feelings matter, regardless
            of what anyone has told us. So darlings, let's set those boundaries
            and stick to them, ok? 😏

            It's an all-too-familiar scene... my friend's just told me something
            very personal to them, something that's reaaally hard for them to
            talk about, and I'm struggling to say anything in response 😬 It's
            the WORST fucking feeling everrrrrrr. I want to be supportive. I
            want my friend to know that I'm there, I'm listening, I care, but —
            I just don't know how. And that's where these phrases come in handy!
            They help, a lot. Just imagine hearing some of the top 3 after
            telling your bestie something that's been on your mind for WEEKS...
            now compare it to the bottom 3. Much kinder, and healthier, right?
            💁‍♀️ So let's be more mindful of the words we use when we're listening
            to the people we love, we want them to feel our full support, so
            let's work that vocab honey! 💪😘

            Is it just me or has EVERYTHING been draining recently?? I've had
            some awful sleep, and it feels like there isn't enough coffee in the
            WORLD to get me out of it...
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            And I'm starting to think that coffee might be the problem 😅 I
            don't think I've been taking care of my body enough, and maybe
            that's what's making me feel this way? 🤷‍♂️ I mean, I said this to my
            therapist and they nodded their head a lot more than they usually
            do... 🤔<br /><br />So I looked into it, and found Aura. YES, they
            do mindfulness - but nobody does it better! There's a reason they've
            been called the Spotify of Mindfulness and that's because they've
            got loadssss of coaches and professionals giving all the energy we
            need to stay in tune, get focused and live with a little zen! 😇<br
